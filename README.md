# Overview 

I started my career as a SDR (sales development representative). We used an off brand CRM (not sales force), meaning I never got to experience the joys of interactive graphs representing my email response data. Now that I can build what I want to see Iâ€™m making my own type of crm to make applying to work efficient by using data generated myself!
